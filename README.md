**1. Description of data**
The datset to be used for this research is obtained from www.kaggle.com, which is a well renowned site hosting Machine Learning and AI datasets.

Below is an illustration of the structure, composition and explanation of the datset features.

1. Index: Identifier or unique reference for each accident.

2. Accident_Severity: Categorization of the severity of the accident (e.g., serious, slight).

3. Accident Date: Date when the accident happened.

4. Latitude & Longitude: Geographical coordinates of the accident location.

5. Light_Conditions: Conditions of lighting when the accident happened (e.g., Daylight, Night with street   lights, Night without lights).

6. District Area: Specific district or region where the accident occurred.

7. Number_of_Casualties: The number of people injured or killed in the accident.

8. Number_of_Vehicles: The number of vehicles involved in the accident.

9. Road_Surface_Conditions: The condition of the road when the accident occurred (e.g., Dry, Wet, Icy).

10. Road_Type: Type of the road where the accident happened (e.g., Highway, Residential, Main road).

11. Urban_or_Rural_Area: Categorization of the area (e.g., Urban, Rural).

12. Weather_Conditions: The weather conditions during the time of the accident (e.g., Clear, Rainy, Foggy).

13. Vehicle_Type: Type of the main vehicle involved in the accident (e.g., Car, Truck, Motorcycle).
